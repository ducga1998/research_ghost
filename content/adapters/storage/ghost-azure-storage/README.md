# Looking for maintainers.

Hi, I don't use ghost anymore. If you are interested in taking this over [see this issue](https://github.com/TerribleDev/ghost-azurestorage/issues/11)
 
# Ghost Azure

This module allows you to store media file at Azure instead of storing at local machine.

## Installation

#### *nix

* `npm install ghost-azurestorage` (note the absence of `--save`)
* `mkdir content/storage` (make the storage folder if it doesn't exist yet)
* `cp -vR node_modules/ghost-azurestorage content/storage/ghost-azurestorage` (copy the module into the right location)

#### powershell
* `npm install ghost-azurestorage` (note the absence of `--save`)
* `mkdir content/storage` (make the storage folder if it doesn't exist yet)
* `cp -Recurse node_modules/ghost-azurestorage content/storage/ghost-azurestorage` (copy the module into the right location)


## Configuration

Create new azure storage account, and get the connection string (can be found in the preview portal)

Add `storage` block to file `config.js` in each environment as below:
```
     "storage": {
			"active": "ghost-azurestorage",
			"ghost-azurestorage": {
				"connectionString": "YourConnectionStringHere",
				"container": "YourOptionalContainerName",
				"cdnUrl": "YourCDNEndpointDomain",
				"useHttps" : "true" //Optional: CDN protocol. Defaults to http if omitted. Set to "true", to enable.
			}
		},
```

## Environment Variables

You can set your connection string as the Environment Variable `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
